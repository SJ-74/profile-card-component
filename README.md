- Flexbox
-Basic CSS

### What I learned

This challenge was quite fun and challenging. The image part (top and bottom bubbles) was a bit complicated for me. I couldn't find a way for keeping them static at their particular places. So, that part was quite complicated. Overall, it was a nice challenge.

Also, I'm quite proud of this CSS

```css
    background: url('images/bg-pattern-top.svg'), url('images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg'), hsl(185, 75%, 39%);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: right calc(47vw + 15%) bottom calc(65vh - 15vw), left calc(40vw + 25%) top calc(72vh - 10vw);
```

### Continued development

I'm going to focus on using CSS grid and also tinker with images.

### Useful resources

- [Apple Pie Giraffe](https://github.com/ApplePieGiraffe/profile-card-component) - This helped me with the image positioning. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward. I had no knowledge about this pattern. Hats off to APG for figuring this out.

## Acknowledgments

I'd like to thank Apple Pie Giraffe. Honestly I had no prior knowledge about fixing the image at a particular position. Their code really helped me understand that part.
